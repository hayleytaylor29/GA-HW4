//SECTION 1

//1. DRY - DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF - Repeating code over and over can make it difficult to read and understand. Also can make things more difficult to access in other parts
//of your program. It is better to have a more streamlined code to understand more easily and to work with again in the future/make changes.
//2. const - we use this on a variable that will not change, for example <const lastName> - the person's last name will not likely change so we use const
//   let - we use this when the value of the variable can change - local scope
//   var - global scope - can be used and accessed anywhere in the code
